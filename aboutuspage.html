    <h1> What is APMI? </h1>
    <p>APMI, which stands for "Animals Playing Musical Instruments," is a brand created for the person who just so happens to treasure the awe-inspring 
        idea of animals having the intellectual and emotional capability to play musical 
        instruments (sounds awesome, right?). Our apparel is casual, yet stylish, and so very comfortable.
        With all designs custom printed onto Comfort Colors blanks by each member of the APMI
         team, you are guarenteed to love the feel and design of our shirts.
