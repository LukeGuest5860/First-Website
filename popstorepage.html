        <p style="font-size:15px"> Introducing our second design - Penguin on Piamo. <br>
            Gilbert the Goose isn't an ordinary goose. He sticks out from the rest of the flock.
            But we kind of like that about him. Hey, it's kinda how we all feel sometimes. How we all want to feel. Unordinary. Well, 
            that's exactly what Gilbert is. I mean, how else could he be playing guitar? He's literally a goose. So if you're like us,
             and love the uniqueness that this world has to offer, then this shirt is for you.<br> <br>Don't buy it for us. Buy it for Gilbert, the Goose on Guitar 
             <br> <br> Shirts made direct-to-garment from 
             high-quality Comfort Colors&#8482; shirts!
